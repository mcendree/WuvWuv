		<h1>Hello, WuvWuv</h1>
		<h2>You are strong.</h2>
		<h2>You are smart.</h2>
		<h2>You are funny.</h2>
		<h2>You are sexy. </h2>
			<p>When my strength begins to waiver, I think of you and the how swol you are. Our road is long and and there are still many hlls to climb but I know your hand will always be there for me to hold. The future is filled with the a brightness that rivals your smile. I looked foward to seeing where this life will take us. I am no longer looking for isolation but instead I am filled with fear and hope for things to come and what might be. </p>
