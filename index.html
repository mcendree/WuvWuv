		<h1>Hello, WuvWuv</h1>
		<h2>You are <u>strong</u>.</h2>
		<h2>You are <u>smart</u>.</h2>
		<h2>You are <u>funny</u>.</h2>
		<h2>You are <u>sexy</u>. </h2>
			<p> When my strength begins to waiver, I think of you and find the will to temper any obstacle. Our road is long and there are still many hills to climb but I know your hand will always be there for me to hold. The future is filled with a brightness that rivals your smile. I looked forward to seeing where this life will take us. I am no longer looking for isolation but instead I am filled with fear and hope for things to come and what might be.</p>
